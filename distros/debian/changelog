shutorial (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release: ship the squashfs in the package instead of
    rebuilding it upon installation.
  * Remove the postinst script that was building the squashfs and add a
    preinst to remove it when it exists to not conflict with the
    package content.
