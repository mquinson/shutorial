Description: Educational exerciser to teach the shell
 Shutorial is an exerciser to teach the arcane of the UNIX command
 line and the shell in practice. It comes as a set of progressive
 exercises that you can take in a chroot.
 .
 Note that this software is currently under development. Only three
 exercises are provided so far, from the dozen of planned ones.
 .
 This package SHOULD be safe, and I think I got every cases covered to
 avoid priviledge escalation, but I would not advise to install this
 package on a shared machine.
